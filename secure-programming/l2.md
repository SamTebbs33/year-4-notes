# Code injecttion

## Consequences of unexpect input
* Unexpected behaiour
* Resource exhaustion
* Data leakage
* Privilege escalation

## Input types
* Form data
* Program arguments
* DB queries
* Those specific to web:
	* URL
	* HTTP headers
	* Request body
	* Cookies
	* Referer

## Validation

After all inputs and their sources have been identified, they can be validated.

### Methods
* Validate and error
	* Data type
	* Range
	* Length
	* Syntax
* Escaping
* 'safe' APIs

Establish trust boundaries, validate input at each layer and store trusted and untrusted data separately.

When paths are given via a URL or similar, be aware of path traveersal attacks, e.g. 'http://example.org/../../../etc/shadow'.

#### Safe APIs
The API interface can limit the range and type of data allowed, they have more chance of being correct and are heavily supported in libraries. An example is SQL prepared statements.
