# Posters
A0 portrait, presented in the atrium on Monday Week 11 at 13:00.

We will present them to two members of staff, who will assess the poster and the presentation. 5 minutes for a pitch and 5 minutes for discussion.

## Designing
Provide information but not too densely. Focus on what has been done and what is going to be done. Lay it out in a way that shows if you're making good choices.
