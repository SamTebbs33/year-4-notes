You're project doesn't need to be split evenly across the above 4 structure points. Some are more results-focussed etc.

## Motiviation and aims

What the general problem is that you're trying to solve, why it's worth working on.

Has anyone else worked on this before? If so, what did they find and what specific problem will you solve? Incorporating other people's findings can help make your project more robust and valuable (learn from their mistakes).

## Methodology

What you're doing, how you're doing it and why you're doing it that way.

## Results

What you've done, what technical challenges/accomplishments were involved and why did you do things a certain way.

## Evaluation

Did the idea work? How was it tested? What would you do differently a second time round?

# Progress logs
Formative weekly assignment. Write about what you've accomplished the past week and how it fits in with your plan.
Week 2 report closes on the 13th of October.
