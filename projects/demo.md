# Structure
20 minute slot with academic member of staff, who is likely to be the second marker for the project.

Aim for 10-15 minutes of presenting the project and demonstrating the work done. 5 minutes for questions.

# Assessement
Not directly assessed and no mark given.

# Presentation
* Introduce the problem at a high level. Remember that they don't share the context of the project.
* Highlight important aspects, challenges and decisions.
* Not an exhaustive account of everything done.
* Convince them that what's been done is good and interesting.

# Demo
* Planned and structured like the presentation.
* Don't just put the thing in front of them and expect them to know what to do and how to interpret it.
* Guide their attention to the most interesting and important parts.
* Practice it!
