## Structure

### Preamble
* Title
* Abstract: Summary of entire document: what the work was about, the motiviation, the problem question, how it was approached and what was found. 200ish words.
* Contents
* Introducion: **Not** a longer version of the abstract. Convince the read that the project is something interesting and worthwhile. Chance to tell the read what the project is about, what the problems are and why it's important. Remember that the reader may not have any knowledge of the topic.

### Main body
* Literature review
* Method/approach
* Results/evaluation

### Conclusion
Something of a mirror of the introduction. One and a half pages is definitely too long, should be concise. What should the read leave with and what impression should they have of the project. What the final takeaways are and remind the reader what you did.

### Appendix
Important information should not be put in the appendix. The report should be submissible with the appendix removed.. It is there to back up the stuff in the main body.

Could contain code (all of it doesn't have to be as the code will be submitted on its own) and other business
